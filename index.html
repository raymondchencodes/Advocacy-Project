    <h2>About My Topic</h2>
     <p id="interesting">Chicago's illiteracy rate is one of the highest in the United States, with a high of over 90 percent. This is due to the high population of Chicagoans, who are primarily from low-income backgrounds. According to the 2023 Chicago Public Schools state report card, 12.2% of low-income third graders were reading at the expected grade level. </p>
